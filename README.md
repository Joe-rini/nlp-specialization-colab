# ðŸ§  NLP Specialization â€“ Colab Companion Notebooks

This repository provides **Colab-optimized notebooks** based on the excellent work from the  
[DeepLearning.AI Natural Language Processing Specialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/natural-language-processing-specialization/).

The content has been adapted and restructured from:

ðŸ“˜ Original GitHub Source:
