# üß† NLP Specialization ‚Äì Colab Companion Notebooks

This course is derived from DeepLearning.ai's Natural Language Processing Specialization Course 1: Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces ([Course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/natural-language-processing)).
It uses reworks the open-source notebooks from [@amanchadha](https://github.com/amanchadha/coursera-natural-language-processing-specialization) for Google Colab and pedagogic optimization, so that beginners can run a completely self-contained course within the Google Colab environment.

This repository reorganizes and upgrades the original course notebooks into **Colab-ready notebooks** with:
- Clean markdown structure
- All lessons and assignments in one file per week
- Gradio-powered interactive tools
- Coursera-style quiz self-checks

---

## üìò Course 1: Classification and Vector Spaces
**Topics Covered:**
- Preprocessing tweets (tokenization, stemming, stopwords)
- Visualizing word frequencies
- Logistic regression for sentiment classification
- Feature extraction from text
- Training & evaluating on `twitter_samples`
- Gradio interface for live prediction
- Self-check quizzes

## üìÖ Week 1 ‚Äî Natural Language Processing with Classification & Vector Spaces

| Day | Notebook | What you‚Äôll build & learn | Open in Colab |
|-----|----------|----------------------------|----------------|
| L1  | C1W1_L1_Preprocessing_Teaching.ipynb | Clean & tokenise raw tweets, remove stop-words, apply stemming, then test everything on a toy sentence and an NLTK Twitter corpus. Ends with an interactive Gradio preprocessing playground. | [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Joe-rini/nlp-specialization-colab/blob/main/C1W1_L1_Preprocessing_Teaching.ipynb) |
| L2  | C1W1_L2_Visualizing_Word_Frequencies_Teaching_v2.ipynb | Turn tokens into frequency dictionaries, draw bar-plots & sentiment-split word-clouds, and explore any text live in a Gradio word-frequency app. | [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Joe-rini/nlp-specialization-colab/blob/main/C1W1_L2_Visualizing_Word_Frequencies_Teaching_v2.ipynb) |
| L3  | C1W1_L3_Logistic_Regression_Teaching_v4.ipynb | Convert tweets to simple (pos, neg) feature vectors, train & visualise a Logistic Regression classifier, plot its decision boundary, print accuracy + confusion matrix, and deploy a Gradio sentiment tester. | [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Joe-rini/nlp-specialization-colab/blob/main/C1W1_L3_Logistic_Regression_Teaching_v4.ipynb) |
| A1  | C1W1_A1_Logistic_Regression_Teaching.ipynb | Implement Logistic Regression from scratch with gradient descent. Includes guided TODOs, a cost-convergence plot, accuracy check, and a Gradio app that queries your very own model. | [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Joe-rini/nlp-specialization-colab/blob/main/C1W1_A1_Logistic_Regression_Teaching.ipynb) |

## üìÖ Week 2 ‚Äî Naive Bayes & Vector Representations 

| Day | Notebook | Description | Colab |
|------|----------|-------------|--------|
| L1  | `C1W2_L1_Likelihoods_Teaching_v2.ipynb` | Compute Na√Øve Bayes log-likelihoods for tweets, plot them in (log‚ÄØP‚Çö‚Çí‚Çõ, log‚ÄØP‚Çô‚Çëg) space, draw 95‚ÄØ% confidence ellipses, and explore any tweet live in a Gradio likelihood visualizer. | [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Joe-rini/nlp-specialization-colab/blob/main/C1W2_L1_Likelihoods_Teaching_v2.ipynb) |
| A2  | `C1W2_A1_Naive_Bayes_Teaching_v2.ipynb` | Implement Na√Øve Bayes from scratch using Laplace smoothing. Preserves `### UNQ_Cx` autograder tags, includes local test assertions, and finishes with an interactive Gradio classifier. | [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Joe-rini/nlp-specializ)
