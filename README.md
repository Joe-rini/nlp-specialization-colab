# 🧠 NLP Specialization – Colab Companion Notebooks

[Course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/natural-language-processing)  
Based on the open-source notebooks from [@amanchadha](https://github.com/amanchadha/coursera-natural-language-processing-specialization)

This repository reorganizes and upgrades the original course notebooks into **Colab-ready notebooks** with:
- Clean markdown structure
- All lessons and assignments in one file per week
- Gradio-powered interactive tools
- Coursera-style quiz self-checks

---

## 📘 Course 1: Classification and Vector Spaces
**Topics Covered:**
- Preprocessing tweets (tokenization, stemming, stopwords)
- Visualizing word frequencies
- Logistic regression for sentiment classification
- Feature extraction from text
- Training & evaluating on `twitter_samples`
- Gradio interface for live prediction
- Self-check quizzes

## 📅 Week 1 — Natural Language Processing with Classification & Vector Spaces

## 📘 NLP Specialization Colab Notebooks

| Day | Notebook | What you’ll build & learn | Open in Colab |
|-----|----------|----------------------------|----------------|
| L1  | C1W1_L1_Preprocessing_Teaching.ipynb | Clean & tokenise raw tweets, remove stop-words, apply stemming, then test everything on a toy sentence and an NLTK Twitter corpus. Ends with an interactive Gradio preprocessing playground. | [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Joe-rini/nlp-specialization-colab/blob/main/C1W1_L1_Preprocessing_Teaching.ipynb) |
| L2  | C1W1_L2_Visualizing_Word_Frequencies_Teaching_v2.ipynb | Turn tokens into frequency dictionaries, draw bar-plots & sentiment-split word-clouds, and explore any text live in a Gradio word-frequency app. | [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Joe-rini/nlp-specialization-colab/blob/main/C1W1_L2_Visualizing_Word_Frequencies_Teaching_v2.ipynb) |
| L3  | C1W1_L3_Logistic_Regression_Teaching_v4.ipynb | Convert tweets to simple (pos, neg) feature vectors, train & visualise a Logistic Regression classifier, plot its decision boundary, print accuracy + confusion matrix, and deploy a Gradio sentiment tester. | [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Joe-rini/nlp-specialization-colab/blob/main/C1W1_L3_Logistic_Regression_Teaching_v4.ipynb) |
| A1  | C1W1_A1_Logistic_Regression_Teaching.ipynb | Implement Logistic Regression from scratch with gradient descent. Includes guided TODOs, a cost-convergence plot, accuracy check, and a Gradio app that queries your very own model. | [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Joe-rini/nlp-specialization-colab/blob/main/C1W1_A1_Logistic_Regression_Teaching.ipynb) |
