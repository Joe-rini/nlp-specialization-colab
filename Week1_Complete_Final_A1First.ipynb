    "In Python, a dictionary is a mutable and indexed collection. It stores items as key-value pairs and uses [hash tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table) underneath to allow practically constant time lookups. In NLP, dictionaries are essential because it enables fast retrieval of items or containment checks even with thousands of entries in the collection."
